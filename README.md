## 🔥 **Why This Exists**

We were tired of clunky, ad-filled tools. **NexuJit** is the answer:
*   **Zero Server Latency**: Everything runs locally in your browser. ⚡
*   **Privacy as a Feature**: We don’t store your data because we can’t. It never leaves your machine. 🔒
*   **Aesthetic AF**: Built with a "Midnight Glass" UI that looks as good as it performs. 🎨
*   **100+ Tools**: The largest collection of client-side utilities ever assembled.
